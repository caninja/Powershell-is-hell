# Powershell-is-hell

Hello, this is going to be some microsoft powershell scripts that update, upgrade, installs and uninstalls 3rd party programs for microsoft windows.

If "Get-ExecutionPolicy" is Restricted on the system, you can bypass that with this:
"PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File script.ps1"
